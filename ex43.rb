# ZED PROCESS Top down 
## Write or draw about the problem 
### list all of the nouns and verbs in your writing and drawings
### how are they related 
## Extract key concepts from 1 and research them 
## Create a class hierarchy and object map for the concepts 
## Code the classes and a test to run them 
## repeat and refine 

# ZED PROCESS Bottom Up
## take a small piece of the problem; hack on some code and get it to run barely
## refine the code into something more formal with classes and automated tests. 
## extract the key concepts you're using and try to find research for them
## write a description of whats really going on 
## go back and refine the code, possibly throwing it out and starting over 
## repeat, moving on to some other piece of the problem
